## Overview

This platform is designed to streamline event management within the Sui ecosystem, covering hackathons, seminars, conferences, side events, and all official Sui-hosted events. It enables users to register, submit projects or applications, vote, and evaluate submissions in a transparent and decentralized manner. Additionally, the platform automatically promotes events and displays real-time results using an AI agent.

## Problem

### Current Issues in Sui Event Management

1. **Fragmented Registration & Submission**
    - Events like hackathons, conferences, and side events use separate registration systems (e.g., Typeform, Google Forms), leading to inefficiencies.
2. **Limited Visibility**
    - Event promotion is mainly restricted to Twitter and Suiâ€™s blog, reducing community engagement.
3. **Lack of Transparency in Selection & Evaluation**
    - Submissions and evaluations are not publicly accessible, making it difficult for users and judges to track processes.
4. **Minimal Community Participation**
    - The current system limits feedback and participation to organizers and judges, excluding the wider community.

## Solution

This platform addresses these challenges by:

- Providing a **unified system** for registration and participation in all Sui-related events.
- Displaying all submitted applications and projects in a **structured, publicly accessible format**.
- Enabling **community and judge-based evaluation & voting** to ensure fairness.
- Using **AI-powered automation** to promote events and showcase key highlights.
- Storing participation history and awards on **dynamic NFTs** as proof of engagement.
